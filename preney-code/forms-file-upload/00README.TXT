This example requires Apache be able to WRITE to the current directory.
Remember that such can be a security issue --you should write to a 
directory that is NOT accessible via a URL (i.e., somewhere OUTSIDE
of the "public_html" directory for the web site).

Do read the php.net pages (Document > English > File Uploads) on file
uploading. They have excellent examples on those pages esp. in the comments
section.
